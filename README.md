## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JS

I wanted to get in more CSS grid practice. This project has inspiration from airbnb.

## Lessons Learned

When working with this project there is a ton that goes into `grid` as well as `flex`. One of the great things about `grid` is that you are able to quickly scafold your columns and rows.

TODO:

- Use `grid-template-areas` for more customization instead of having to move `<div>`'s around.
- Make the navbar and footer sticky.
- Integrate with API to make the page more dynamic
